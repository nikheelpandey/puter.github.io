	<h1>Hello World!.</h1>
	<p>I'm a final year <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b> student at
	<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Ghasidas_Vishwavidyalaya" style="color:black">Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya</a></b>
	(a central university) in Bilaspur, Chattisgarh, India.</p>
	<!-- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/me.jpg" ></img> -->
	<p>I developed machine vision algorithm for grading agricultural produces while my internship at <a href="http://agricx.com"style="color:black"> Agricx </a></b>.
	<p>
		I use only open source software to solve computer vision and machine learning problems. As a result, you can find working models on my github page.</p>
	<p>
	 	Ubuntu and python are my main gears. I have been developing algorithms for various problems like Object Recognition, Loan Classification, Character Classifier etc. Although the main library that I use is sklearn, I'm familiar with tflearn, dlib, xgboost etc. I am new to deep learning hence I'd admit that I have made a few rookie mistakes here and thre but I believe with enough practice that'd rectify on its own. I've even started writing my own library "Simplistic-ML suitable for people who are strating to explore machine learning."
