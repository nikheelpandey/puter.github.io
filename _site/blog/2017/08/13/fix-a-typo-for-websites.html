Have you ever read articles on geeksforgeeks.com or tutorialspoint.com or any other such sites. Oh My GOD! They have so many typing mistakes (and sometimes conceptual mistakes). It is just so annoying to see “tor” instead of a “for”!!! Why don’t they fix it? Do you think that is easy. Having more than thousands of articles on their site, who will bother reading them all, and that to with full attention just for fixing a few typos. But the admin just don’t know the frustation of the readers on those typos. Well, admin would say, “Ok, tell me where is the typo I will fix it”. Users will say, “Nice. But how?” Please don’t flood the comment section telling those little mistakes. So the solution? Now here’s my idea." />

What idea? Have you ever read articles on geeksforgeeks.com or tutorialspoint.com or any other such sites. Oh My GOD! They have so many
typing mistakes (and sometimes conceptual mistakes). It is just so annoying to see “tor” instead of a “for”!!!
Why don’t they fix it? Do you think that is easy. Having more than thousands of articles on their site, who will bother reading them
all, and that to with full attention just for fixing a few typos. But the admin just don’t know the frustation of the readers
on those typos. Well, admin would say, “Ok, tell me where is the typo I will fix it”. Users will say, “Nice. But how?”

So the solution?
Now here’s my idea.</p>
