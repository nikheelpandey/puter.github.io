    <span class="description">This is an ongoing research in computer vision and deep learning. I am trying to develop an algorithm for segmentation and classification of diseases in plants and other produces. The goal here is to derrive an algorithm robust enough to perform all the segmentation and disease classification task yet simple enough to be deployed on android phones so that farmers, cold-storage owners etc can directly benifit from this. My case study is on potato as it one of the most prominent product stored in Indian storages. I'd like to mention the internship at Agricx that led me into this field. Agricx is start-up that certify and grade the potatoes with regards with industrial standard. They have been generous enough to provide me with the raw data. You may visit their site <a href="agricx.com">here</a>
