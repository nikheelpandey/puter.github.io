        This is an ongoing research in computer vision and deep learning. I am trying to develop an algorithm for segmentation and classification of diseases in plants and other produces. The goal here is to derrive an algorithm robust enough to perform all the segmentation and disease classification task yet simple enough to be deployed on android phones so that farmers, cold-storage owners etc can directly benifit from this.


        My case study is on potato as it one of the most prominent product stored in Indian storages. I'd like to mention the internship at Agricx that led me into this field. Agricx is start-up that certify and grade the potatoes with regards to industrial standard. They have been generous enough to provide me with the raw data.

        I always wished if I had a library of my own. I know sklearn is great and all, but this is my own library for dataa science. I think every data scientist should have one of thier own. It just so nice to work when you know every single bit of code. Checkout <a href="https://github.com/nikhilpandey360/Simplistic-ML">Simplistic ML </a> <span>

        In this project we had to predict from data given about customers how likely they are to pay the loan back. I trained various model. To be honest this was my first attempt at data science and since then my grasp of algorithms have gotten better.

    	It was my first attempt at deep learning. I had heard about kaggle but never really took any participation though. There I came to know about tflearn library and I was amazed to see how simple it was to build a classifier. I studied CNN and ANN by watching Andrew Ngâ€™s lectures on coursera. I made a image classifier that can detect whether there is a cat or dog in an image.
		The architecture was really simple. I was surprised to see the vast difference in amount of time required for training in case of CUDA supported GPU vs Normal CPU. It finally got an accuracy of 89% and that time I thought that's enough. You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/nikhilpandey360/ImageClssifiers_CNN/blob/master/catvdog.ipynb">here</a>.
