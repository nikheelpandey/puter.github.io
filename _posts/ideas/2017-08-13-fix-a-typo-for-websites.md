This idea has been in my mind for a couple of months. And I hope to get it done as soon as I get some free time.<br>
What idea?<br>
Have you ever read articles on geeksforgeeks.com or tutorialspoint.com or any other such sites. Oh My GOD! They have so many typing mistakes (and sometimes conceptual mistakes). It is just so annoying to see "tor" instead of a "for"!!!<br>
Why don't they fix it? Do you think that is <b>easy</b>. Having more than thousands of articles on their site, who will bother reading them all, and that to with full attention just to fix a few typos. But the admin just don't know the frustation of the readers on those typos. Well, admin would say, "Ok, tell me where is the typo I will fix it". Users will say, "Nice. But how?"<br>
Please don't flood the comment section telling those little mistakes.<br>
So the solution?<br>
Now here's my idea.<br>
There should be a feature on such websites that allow user to report any typo to the website admin. Just select the portion you think is erranous, click on something say a button, a pop up will appear. Write down the correction. Submit. Now the admin can see all the typos that the users report, and correct it with just a click. or ignore it if it isn't a typo and just a fake report. Admin can also thank, or maybe reward the reporter. <br>
A lot of other features can be added to it.
